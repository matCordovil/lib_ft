# core_cursus_projs

This project is meant to teach us how a library works and how we can make our own.

In the libft directory you can see the mandatory part only for this project. This includes a bunch of functions that recreate the io of many already existing function such as strlen, strncmp, atoi, and so forth.

In the final_lib directory you will find the bonus part as well. This includes functions that work around linked lists and nodes. It was a great way of learning how to work with structs.

Each directory has their own Makefile that will compile everything, just run make in the terminal and you will have the library up and running.

Feel free to use it in your projects if you want to.
